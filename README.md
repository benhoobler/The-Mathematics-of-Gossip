# "The-Mathematics-of-Gossip"

The spread of rumors has been described as “infection of the mind” and their spread is analogous to the spread of an infectious disease, such as Ebola. This analogy is made due to information being passed on from carrier to carrier through a network of contacts [6]. Like a disease, the spreading of rumors can be modeled by differential equations and then numerically simulated for different situations. Studying the function provides information on how to suppress rumors from spreading or successfully spread rumors for malicious intent.

This project conducts steady-state analyses and numerical simulations on a modified Susceptible/Infectious/Recovered(SIR) model to investigate the spread of rumors, lies, and misinformation that take place throughout the world today. Maple and MATLAB is used present a numerical simulations using a Runge-Kutta method and the stability of the dynamical system. The models will be adapted SIR models used to simulate the transmission and spread of the Ebola virus in 2014. Different parameters will be tested such as: susceptibility of “infection” depending on the source of the information, forgetting and remembering rumors, and the probability that an infected host can realize the rumor is false.
